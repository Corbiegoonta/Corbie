While deploying I got an error,
Daemon functionality is currently not supported on Windows.
Daemon's service failed.
I tried to create a new stack to deploy as you suggested in the video, but, I'm still facing the same issue...

On windows, we need to install WSL (linux in windows) & ubuntu distribution (any Linux dist) and then install conda along with required environment. After the successfully environment creation, run the commands as in video, it will work.
